Brittany is pretty cute so I had to lock her in when I had the chance.

Brittany, say something nice about me. "Charlie goes and gets me ice cream at midnight sometimes." Thanks.

### THE MAID OF HONOR
#### KIANA FONG

Things were going great for me after I was born until about 4 years later when Kiana was born. After that, my life has been forever ruined.

### THE BEST MAN
#### ROBBY HARRIS

Robby and I met at UTC. I think we became best friends during our time in the foxhole known as Computer Architecture. We came out alive, but were it not for Robby, I, like many other of my friends, would not have made it through college without his genius and support. Robby currently works at TVA just over the wall from me where we continue to enjoy 30-45 minute coffee breaks together.

### THE BRIDESMAID
#### RACHEL SALTER

<Insert how Brittany and Rachel met or whatever here>

### THE OFFICIANT
#### SKYY BIGFORD

Skyy is the Joey to our Monica and Chandler. He's always been a wonderful, creative, supportive friend to both of us. Skyy and Brittany were roommates in college and had a ton of fun making music together. Skyy was one of the first friends CJ made when he first moved to Chattanooga. You always know you're going to have a good time when Skyy shows up.
