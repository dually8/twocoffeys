Brittany is pretty cute so I had to lock her in when I had the chance.

Brittany, say something nice about me. "Charlie goes and gets me ice cream at midnight sometimes." Thanks.

### THE MAID OF HONOR
#### KIANA FONG

Things were going great for me after I was born until about 4 years later when Kiana was born. After that, my life has been forever ruined.

### THE BEST MAN
#### ROBBY HARRIS

Robby and CJ met at UTC and became best friends during their time in the foxhole known as Computer Architecture. They formed a coallition with their other friends in the class, and everyone made it out alive thanks to Robby's genius and support. Robby currently works at TVA just over the wall from CJ where they continue to enjoy 30-45 minute coffee breaks together.

### THE BRIDESMAID
#### RACHEL SALTER

Rachel and Brittany met at their middle school's orchestra camp, where they both played cello and discovered they were long-lost twins born 1 day apart... on opposite ends of the country. Their mutual love of being silly and using the word "dude" in every sentence forged a friendship that has endured the test of time.

### THE OFFICIANT / GROOMSMAN
#### SKYY BIGFORD

Skyy is the Joey to our Monica and Chandler. He's always been a wonderful, creative, supportive friend to both of us. Skyy and Brittany were roommates in college and had a ton of fun making music together. Skyy was one of the first friends CJ made when he first moved to Chattanooga. You always know you're going to have a good time when Skyy shows up.
