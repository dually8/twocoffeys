Brittany and CJ met in 2011 at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga where they were both music students. They shared their first "kiss" on stage as Tessa and Giuseppe in the Spring 2012 opera workshop performance of Gilbert & Sullivan's _The Gondoliers_. They've been inseparable ever since that fateful casting decision made by their opera workshop director and vocal studies professor, Perry Ward. For this, they say, "Grazie!"

CJ proposed to Brittany using a diamond from his grandmother's ring in a setting that they picked out together.
